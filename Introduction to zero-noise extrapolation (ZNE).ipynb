    "<b>Introduction</b> <br>\n",
    "One day, we’ll have big fault tolerant computers. They’ll work flawlessly, automatically correcting any errors that occur. But, unfortunately, this isn’t the situation at the moment. \n",
    "\n",
    "Today’s quantum computers are relatively small and, more importantly, noisy. This means that we need to think carefully about their noise and how to work around it. One technique for doing this is <i>zero-noise extrapolation</i> or <i>ZNE</i>.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>What is ZNE?</b> <br>\n",
    "ZNE was first introduced in 2017 <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1612.02058\">[1]</a> <a href=\"https://journals.aps.org/prx/abstract/10.1103/PhysRevX.7.021050\">[2]</a>. It’s based on the idea of systematically <i>adding extra noise</i> to a circuit. After doing this, we measure the expectation value of some observable and, finally, extrapolate back to the ideal case with zero noise. \n",
    "\n",
    "At first glance, ZNE seems like a strange idea. It involves emulating a noiseless quantum computer by adding more noise. However, the key idea is that we add noise in a systematic way. This allows us to learn the system's noise behaviour. Next, we use this knowledge to extrapolate to the behaviour of an ideal, noiseless quantum computer.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>Why should you care about ZNE?</b> <br>\n",
    "ZNE is incredibly important as it allows us to efficiently determine the expectation values that a perfect, error-free quantum computer would have measured. But, using one of today’s imperfect error-prone quantum computers. \n",
    "\n",
    "This is important it opens the door to doing something useful on today's quantum computers. More specifically, to demonstrating something called <a href=\"https://research.ibm.com/blog/what-is-quantum-utlity\">quantum utility.</a>\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum utility is the ability of a quantum computer to perform calculation that no brute-force classical calculation can reproduce (in a reasonable amount of time). Note that this does <i>not</i> mean that it’s impossible to come up with a specifically tailored, sophisticated classical algorithm that can reproduce the result. But, instead, that it’s impossible for a general-purpose algorithm to do it.\n",
    "\n",
    "Quantum utility is a key milestone in the experimental realization of quantum computers and quantum advantage.\n",
    "\n",
    "<b>How can I implement ZNE?</b> <br>\n",
    "<h2 style=\"font-size: value;\">\n",
    "The details of ZNE are complicated. So, you might think that you need to be an expert on quantum computers—and quantum physics—to implement it in your quantum programs. But, nothing could be further from the truth.<br> \n",
    "<h2 style=\"font-size: value;\">\n",
    "Using some of Qiskit’s new features, you can implement it in just a single line of code.\n",
    "<h2 style=\"font-size: value;\">\n",
    "Here it is:<br><br>\n",
    "<i>options.resilience_level = 2</i>\n",
    "<h2 style=\"font-size: value;\">\n",
    "That’s all there is to it.\n",
